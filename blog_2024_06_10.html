        	<h1>WHY EYE CONTACT DOESN'T MATTER</h1>
        	<p>It‚Äôs 2:00pm and raining outside as enter my third week of being in Asia.</p>
        	<p>I‚Äôve been using my time with family here (the only thing that takes priority over my work) as an excuse to take a break, slow down, and reflect.</p>
        	<p>There‚Äôs something about being around people who have known you your whole life, that makes you think a little differently about Connection.</p>
        	<p>I wanted to talk about ‚ÄúConnection To Self‚Äù today, but I noticed something about eye contact that I can‚Äôt seem to ignore for another week.</p>
        	<p>I was told early in my pole journey that connecting with the audience was about eye contact.</p>
        	<p>And that was it.</p>
        	<p>When you‚Äôve been pole dancing for only a few years, you still feel uncomfortable in tiny booty shorts, and you can barely freestyle for 30 seconds; it seems like eye contact is the holy grail of ‚Äúconnection‚Äù in performance. Just making it to where you can confidently look into the eyes of your audience and not at that imaginary dot above their heads (<i>*ahem*</i> Mimi circa 2018), seems like a lifetime‚Äôs journey in itself.</p>
        	<p>But when you talk with someone, we know connection is about more than just eye contact. So why did I and everyone else think it was any different on stage?</p>
        	<p>Have you noticed how different eye contact feels with someone you don‚Äôt click with, versus someone you truly connect with?</p>
        	<p>With someone you don‚Äôt connect with, it can feel forced, even a bit awkward. You might feel pressured to maintain eye contact, even though you don‚Äôt want to. But with someone you genuinely connect with, there‚Äôs an easy flow of energy. Locking eyes and looking away feel equally natural and there‚Äôs no subtle feeling of resistance or force.</p>
        	<p>Eye contact in performances have been thrown around haphazardly the same way ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù was said to all the wrong people and in all the wrong ways in our early years.</p>
        	<p>We‚Äôve been using it indiscriminately, thinking that‚Äôs the key to creating a connection.</p>
        	<p>Meanwhile audience members are sitting terrified and uncomfortable because the stranger on stage decided to lock eyes with them and they weren‚Äôt drunk enough for that yet.</p>
        	<p>I‚Äôd say external confidence is the primary reason eye contact is used in such alarming, performative ways. You don‚Äôt need confidence to create a connection.</p>
        	<p>What you need is <b>courage.</b></p>
        	<p>Courage to be unimpressive. Courage to be ‚Äúboring‚Äù.</p>
        	<p><i>Courage to be authentically you.</i></p>
        	<p>More on this next week.</p>
        	<p>Until then, here‚Äôs a video of the performance that made me realize all this about eye contact. It‚Äôs my favorite one to date. It‚Äôs also a freestyle and the longest Flow State I have on video. It would mean a lot if you watched and shared it üôè</p>
