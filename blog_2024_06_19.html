        	<h1>WHAT I'M NERVOUS TO TELL YOU</h1>
        	<p>Most days I wake up to thoughts of blueberry oatmeal ü•£ü´ê ü§§</p>
        	<p>But these days I‚Äôve been jolted awake by thoughts of Connection.</p>
        	<p><b>My latest morning intrusion:</b> How can we expect to be authentic on stage if we are not first authentic to ourselves?</p>
        	<p>There are levels to that old saying ‚Äúlove yourself before you can love others‚Äù.</p>
        	<p>When you‚Äôre a self-sabotaging, 20-something-year-old, with a chip on your shoulder about XYZ, insecurities through the roof and no concept of self worth‚Äîjust learning to find things to love about yourself is a struggle.</p>
        	<p>A lot of us think we‚Äôre done when we finally do feel some love for ourselves. But it‚Äôs one thing to love the great parts of you that are easy to love, another to accept the not-so-great parts of you, and a whole different ball game to lean into the parts you want to hide from the world.</p>
        	<p>Life doesn‚Äôt condition us to play that game.</p>
        	<p>Back in April, I did my first freestyle performance where the only thing I prepared was the song.</p>
        	<p><i>It absolutely sucked.</i></p>
        	<p>I thought that my inability to get into the song, feel, or move the way I usually do was because I was wearing heels and shorts. And if I‚Äôm going to freestyle in heels and shorts, I need to practice more in heels and shorts.</p>
        	<p>So I made a resolution: Every movement session I‚Äôd put on heels for at least one song.</p>
        	<p>For most sessions, this worked out ok, but late one night in my apartment, I found myself delaying that resolution. I was running through every excuse in my head to not put my heels on:</p>
        	<p>"I‚Äôll wait until summer when it's more comfortable to be in heels."</p>
        	<p>or "I‚Äôll slowly work up to it with one more song."</p>
        	<p>After an hour of mental civil war, the absurdity of it all finally hit me. Why am I forcing myself to wear heels? Why is it so important that I get used to dancing in heels?</p>
        	<p>None of the reasons I‚Äôd always clung to - aesthetics, sex appeal, audience engagement - resonated with Me.</p>
        	<p>In that moment of clarity, putting away my heels felt like liberation, like shedding a heavy weight and taking a step into the light.</p>
        	<p>This might come as a surprise and maybe disappointment to those of you that very closely associate me with heels. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôm known for‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs what people fly me across the world for and it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve won titles for.</p>
        	<p>But that version of me was the one that I wanted the world to see and not the most authentic me.</p>
        	<p>I‚Äôve waited awhile to share this publicly, telling myself that maybe it was just a phase. But the real reason I waited was because I was (and still am) afraid.</p>
        	<p>Like I said last week, you need courage to be authentic.</p>
        	<p>The courage to lose my reputation, to be perceived as boring, and to disappoint my followers; was a courage that took me a while to muster.</p>
        	<p>What are you seeking the courage to unveil?</p>
        	<p>Until next week,</p>
        	<p>üíã Mimi</p>
